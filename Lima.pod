=head1 NAME

Date::Lima - A time interval format (2d4h1m4s) like convert_time() from Lima mudlib.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Date::Lima qw/beek_date/;

    my $d1 = beek_date( "127:34" ); # 1h40m
    my $d2 = beek_date("2:46:40" ); # 2h46m40s
    my $d3 = beek_date( 7654321 );  # 2mo4w14h12m1s

=head2 B<beek_date()>

L<beek_date()> takes a single argument.  The argument can be a number of
seconds, an hours-minutes string, or an hours-minutes-seconds string.

=head1 TUNING CONVERSIONS

There are a few pre-built conversions you can use, but you can also fine tune
this as much as you like.

    # bring in all the conversion methods along with beek_date():

    use Date::Lima qw(:all);

=over 4

=item B<nomonth_conversions()>

Disable the C<'mo'> time units.

    nomonth_conversions();

    my $d4 = beek_date( 7654321 );  # 12w4d14h12m1s

=item B<weeklargest_conversions()>

Disable both the year and the month conversions.

    weeklargest_conversions();

    my $d5 = beek_date( 7654321 );  # 12w4d14h12m1s

=item B<daysmallest_conversions()>

Ignore the hours, minutes and seconds

    daysmallest_conversions();
    my $days = beek_date(86400*32 + 3600*12 + 77); # 1mo2d

=item B<sidereal_conversions()>

Use the sidereal year length as an important unit for C<y> and C<mo>.

    my $sidereal_year  = 365.256_363_051 * 24 * 60 * 60;
    my $sidereal_month = $sidereal_year / 12;

    @conversions = (
        [  y => $sidereal_year  ],
        [ mo => $sidereal_month ],

        [  w => 7*24*60*60 ],
        [  d =>   24*60*60 ],
        [  h =>      60*60 ],
        [  m =>         60 ],
    );

=item B<default_conversions()>

You do not normally need to run this.  It's handy for putting things back they
way they were.

    daysmallest_conversions();
    my $days = beek_date(86400*32 + 3600*12 + 77); # 1mo2d

    default_conversions();
    my $interval = beek_date(86400*32 + 3600*12 + 77); # 1mo2d12h1m17s

=item B<@Date::Lima::conversions>

There will obviously be some disagreement about how long a "week" or a "month"
is.  You can define your own in this way:

    @Date::Lima::conversions = (
        [ d => 86400 ], # days are 86400 seconds
        [ E => 1337 ], # elite time unit
        [ m => 60 ], # minutes are 60 seconds
        [ s => 1 ], # seconds are 1 second
    );

    my $weird = beek_date( 7777777 ); # 90d1E7m20s

This will not work right unless the largest units are first.  It's up to you to
make sure they're ordered largest to smallest.

=head1 NOTE

L</convert_time()> was technically written by cowl originally, but it exists in
its present form because of beek.  Also, this pseudo-historical information goes
back to about 1990.  Seems like yesterday.
