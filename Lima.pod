=head1 NAME

Date::Lima - A time interval format (2d4h1m4s) like convert_time() from Lima mudlib.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Date::Lima qw/beek_date/;

    my $d1 = beek_date( "127:34" ); # 1h40m
    my $d2 = beek_date("2:46:40" ); # 2h46m40s
    my $d3 = beek_date( 7654321 );  # 2mo4w14h12m1s

=head1 ALTERNATE CONVERSIONS

There are a few prebuilt conversions you can use.

    use Date::Lima qw(:all);

=over 4

=item C<nomonth_conversions()> eliminates the month conversion.

    nomonth_conversions();

    my $d4 = beek_date( 7654321 );  # 12w4d14h12m1s

=item C<weeklargest_conversions()> eliminates both the year and the month conversion.

    weeklargest_conversions();

    my $d5 = beek_date( 7654321 );  # 12w4d14h12m1s

=item C<@Date::Lima::conversions>

There will obviously be some disagreement about how long a "week" or a "month"
is.  You can define your own in this way:

    @Date::Lima::conversions = (
        [ d => 86400 ], # days are 86400 seconds
        [ E => 1337 ], # elite time unit
        [ m => 60 ], # minutes are 60 seconds
        [ s => 1 ], # seconds are 1 second
    );

    my $weird = beek_date( 7777777 ); # 90d1E7m20s

=back

This will not work right unless the largest units are first.  It's up to you to
make sure they're ordered largest to smallest.
